### Linux Installation
#### Requirements
* Qt>=5.9.5 (Ubuntu 18.04 or later)

#### Installation
A release package for Linux can be downloaded from the [Release] page.

QCounter does not require system-wide installation. Just extract the archive in a location of your choice and start it by launching `QCounter` from there.

Note: Make sure `QCounter` is made executable.

### Compiling from source
QCounter has been developed with QtCreator 4.6.2, and the source code repository includes a project file for it. This should allow you to import the project directly into QtCreator. Provided you have an appropriate kit for your platform you should be able to compile it without any problems.

QCounter has been developed and tested using Qt 5.11.1. Any Qt version later than this should be compatible.
